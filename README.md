Lab 1: Git &amp; Github for ML projects
Hi, this is Semat, I'm a Cybersecurity and digital forensics student. I have an experince in network and digital forensics analysis, GRC governance, and programming with many languages. I'm looking forward to learn more about ML and I'm planning to deveolp a tool that can predicate an intrusion on the network before it happens using ML.
